Pokemon Master Training

These files are exclusively for RIKEN CBS lunch study group. 

I recommand you to install python 3.6 through anaconda distribution.

https://www.anaconda.com/download

After installing anaconda, execute anaconda navigator, you are able to see jupyter notebook icon.

Next, download the Pokemon.xlsx and Python plotting practice.ipynb in your local disk (In the same folder).

Launch jupyter notebook, it will open a new tab in your browser.

Find the .ipynb file and open it, you are able to execute the code in the notebook.

You can also test the codes in spyder (another python IDE). 

Try to read and change the codes as you like. 

If time allows, I will prepare another notebook for different python practice.

Enjoy!
